# Improving on traditional gene set enrichment analysis methods using fuzzy set theory
Pathway enrichment analysis is a widely used method for enhancing the interpretation of high-throughput omics data. It aims to identify annotated metabolic or signaling pathways associated with differences in gene expression between two conditions. Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) are the most commonly applied techniques for pathway analysis. However, their performance is limited by their disregard for pathway topology and overlap and the fact that pathway annotation is incomplete. 

Here we apply fuzzy set theory to expand the capabilities of the most widely used pathway analysis methods, ORA and GSEA. In fuzzy set theory, elements receive a degree of membership ranging from 0 to 1, rather than being strictly classified as either belonging to a set or not. We show how derive gene set memberships from pathway overlap, topology, and functional association networks to transform pathway gene sets into fuzzy sets. This approach supports a more customized approach to pathway analysis.
